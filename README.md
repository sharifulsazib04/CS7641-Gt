## 1. Introduction

Traffic sign recognition (TSR) system is an indispensable part of autonomous self-driving car technologyand advanced driver assistance system(ADAS). There are many variabilities, such as collected image quality, lightening conditions, viewpoints, and motion blur, which have a high impact on the robustness of TSR tools (Few-shot traffic sign recognition with clustering inductive bias and random neural network).
